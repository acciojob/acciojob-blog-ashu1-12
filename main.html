		<p>We can say that optimization is the process of making something as effective or functional as possible. In computing or engineering, it involves improving performance, efficiency, or resource usage. Whether it's reducing load time in a website or maximizing output in a production system, optimization helps achieve better results with minimal input. It often requires analyzing trade-offs to find the best possible solution.</p>

DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) builds the foundation, helping you understand how to store and process data efficiently. Competitive programming takes it further by applying those concepts under time constraints, improving speed and accuracy. Together, they prepare you for coding interviews and logical challenges.</p>
